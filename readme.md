# sysDeny
Welcome to this short readme for the sysDeny program. sysDeny is a small project that can be used in such applications as scambaiting or pranks.

On all Windows Vista & 7 computers there is a program called syskey.exe that people can use to essentialy lock down your computer. This program is designed to confuse the suspect and give them a small jumpscare at the end.

## Notes
- Only replace the syskey.exe program if you know what you are doing
- Never do scambaiting or similar on your computer, always use a VM
- I am not responsable for any damage you cause to your or others computers.
